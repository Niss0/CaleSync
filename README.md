# CaleSync

## Description
CaleSync is a collaborative scheduling platform designed to streamline group coordination by automatically identifying common free time slots among team members. Users can create groups, mark their availability on a shared calendar, and effortlessly find optimal meeting times for everyone involved.

## Why?
Finding a common time for group activities can be surprisingly challenging. As a League of Legends player, I frequently encountered difficulties coordinating practice sessions with my team. While this challenge began in gaming, I realized it's a universal problem affecting study groups, professional teams, and social gatherings alike.

CaleSync solves this by:
- Eliminating the back-and-forth of checking everyone's schedules
- Visualizing overlapping free time slots automatically
- Making group coordination efficient and hassle-free
- Ensuring no team member is accidentally excluded from important sessions
